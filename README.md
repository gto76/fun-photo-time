* Written in Java.
* Uses Swing for GUI.
* A lot of filters
* Arithmetic and logic operations between images (add, subtract, and, or...)
* No undo! Every operation opens new frame with processed image.
* 'Tile all' command that nicely tiles all frames inside main frame
* Single key shortcuts for all commands
